This repo contains my Linux config files managed using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) (I guess it's called like that because it means "my home" in french). 
The two main reasons to maintain this repo are backing up my settings and also being able to move from my personal laptop and my office PC seamlessly (or at least that's the objective).

The configurations mainly target:

- tmux (heavily influenced by this)
- z shell
- vim (mostly deprecated)
- neovim
- zathura


Feel free to explore and take what you find useful or leave recommendations :)
